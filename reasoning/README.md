### Implementation
 
* neural networks (see fcm, fgcm)
* bayesian networks (see c2d, nbbn, swet)
* markov logic networks (see mmln)
* plan/workflow composers (see gps, map, resto, restpath)
* control systems (see cs)
* quantum computation (see dqc)
* mathematical computation (see equation4, fib, lldm, pi, tak)
* logic puzzles (see 4color, dp, einstein, graph, hanoi, witch)
* etc...
