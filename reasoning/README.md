### Formalizing, Linking, Unifying and Inferring Data -- FLUID

### Architecture and design

The Semantic Web Databus and Proofbus from [Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/) which is  
like a world wide welding machine transforming data into pragmatic proofs:

### Implementation
 
* neural networks (see fcm, fgcm)
* bayesian networks (see c2d, nbbn, swet)
* markov networks (see mmln)
* workflow composers (see gps, map, resto, restpath)
* control systems (see cs)
* evolutionary algorithms (see ea)
* quantum computation (see dqc)
* mathematical computation (see 4eq, equation4, fib, lldm, pi, tak)
* logic puzzles (see 4color, dp, einstein, graph, hanoi, witch)
* etc...
